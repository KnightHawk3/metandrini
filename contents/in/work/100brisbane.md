## Methodology and stuff

Due to the density of information packed in the exhibition, visitors may be unsure of where to start. As such, the application recommends a route/displays to check out based on how much time they have and the topic they are interested in. This prototype was designed on Adobe XD. The color scheme is taken from the exhibition's style guide, and the colors we use for every page here correspond to the colors associated with the actual sections in the exhibition for better identification.
