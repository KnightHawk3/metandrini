  These are my logo design collection for a variety of clients.  It is always challenging and fun for me to express worldview of brands with typography, metaphor.

### Stimpacks

Stimpacks is a snack company which focus a young adult hardcore gamers. The logo combines the clan flag and thunderbolt symbols. A clan is a group of gamers that come together to accomplish some mission. Using the clan flag and a thunderbolt together symbolizes our mission to give gamers the boost they need.

### Signifiant
Signifiant is a French philosophical term, which is a signifier that is the vehicle of meaning. What feelings does Signifiant Inc. provoke to the entrepreneurs, who are the audience? My concept is “air”, like the atmosphere of an era, employee, corporate personality… People can’t see air, but it is a necessity for the living. And when the wind blows, we perceive the air. Let’s inspire new management wisdom into companies.

### Remote Style

Remote Style provides an opportunity to work flexibly like remote working to designers and engineers. My role was to create a new visual identity and web design. The concept was "Let's work in your favorite environment and while seeing your favorite scene".
