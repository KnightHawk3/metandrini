  Laughly is an audio-based comedy streaming app. Their aims to become a platform to create and promote comedic brands at an individual or organizational level. They desired to integrate both audio and video formats into the app and to bring the audience and comedian together to create a social community.
  
  I tackled the issues with designing the new structure of channel page. Also, I lead the design team making hi-fidelity and prototype.

## User Insight

We kicked off the project by interviewing for people who are using Laughly or love comedy. If Laughly started to provide comedy video, they said they would watch the video. On the other hand, they were feeling comfortable with listening audio in the background for a car in commute.

*Issue: How can user switch video and audio?*

## Channel Navigation

Laughly has several formats, like an album, podcast, playlist and, besides trying to add video. My design focus was how I organize the different type of contents to cater to an audience.
I designed and iterated channel navigation. The design decision was prioritizing to separate types of content into ALL, AUDIO and VIDEO based on the user insight.

Ver1: The initial design was to align with all type of contents, but that wasn't easy to switch audio and video.

Ver2: Added filter feature instead, but this design had the problem what is hard to expand items of filtering in the future.

Ver3: Changed filter UI, and tested it for usability. Some users thought this filter button was a search box.

Ver4: The final design, modified the filter button.

## Thumbnail

Audio and video formats had to be distinguished for combining these on one screen. The critical difference between audio and video formats is the ratio of the thumbnail, and there is play mark or not.

## Reviews

[動画（mov）を載せる]

There was comment feature on channel page, but that is confusing users by what they should leave. About an artist? or a work?
So I changed the label Comment to Review. And then moved it to a content page like album, playlist, media player. That makes more clear that writing for a work.

In a media player, the review feature shows up at the half of screen to read reviews during watching album cover or video without transition.


### Review button

The results of usability testing, users found that the Write Review button was too hidden, which would deter them from engaging with it without being prompted. I moved the Write Review button to next to the rating on playlist page. It is easy to find the button and users can go the writing page directly.

## Design System

I focused on mainly UI design, worked in Sketch, made the design system and bunch of components to allow 8 designers to design consistently.

### Sketch symbol

We had to make a lot of screens and iterate it frequently to validate usability. My challenge was making Sketch symbols that other designers can override the symbol easily and efficiently.
