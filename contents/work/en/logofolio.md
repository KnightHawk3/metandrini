### Signifiant

Signifiant is a French philosophical term, which is a signifier that is the vehicle of meaning. What feelings does Signifiant Inc. provoke to the entrepreneurs, who are the audience? My concept is “air”, like the atmosphere of an era, employee, corporate personality… People can’t see air, but it is a necessity for the living. And when the wind blows, we perceive the air. Let’s inspire new management wisdom into companies.
