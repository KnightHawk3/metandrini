## Research

To start, I researched and placed logos of global and Japanese investment funds in the four-quadrant.

They provided me with keywords, “Alternative”, “Pop” and “Soft” for their brand, which is a representation of their commitment to disrupt the old business practices and bring a breath of fresh air into the Japanese startup scene. So I mapped them to modern side.
