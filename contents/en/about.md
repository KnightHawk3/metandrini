I'm a product designer with 10 years of experience working closely with startups to create and foster brands through end to end experience design. When I worked for a creative agency as an interactive planner and UI designer, I had created promotional videos for Google Japan, Niantic, and PlayStation to connect brand and users.

Generally, marketing and product are separately but I would love to design user experience consistently.

In my spare time, I like playing video game, watching anime and drinking green tea.
