Hi there! My name is Meta, I graduated from The University of Indonesia and The University of Queensland in 2018 with Bachelors of Computer Science and Information Technology, respectively. I am a UI/UX designer who sees my work as challenges to solve in the most beautiful way possible.

My foray into UI/UX began in 2016 during my sophomore year of university; a natural progression after having dabbled in graphic design and HTML/CSS from high school. At that point, I had moved my way up from churning out graphics and decorative web elements on Internet forums to designing publication assets for school and faculty events, so I set my eyes on UI/UX as the new exciting thing!

I am a quick learner who's always up for a challenge (ask me about that time I had to learn Adobe Illustrator in under a week to design posters and make illustrations! Or when I surprised my supervisor by coding a micro-interaction prototype on Framer for the first time!). Working by myself or in a team, on one project for the same startup or on websites for different clients, I am keen to sink my teeth into new experiences. Currently, I seek to expand my knowledge by branching out to mobile applications and/or research.
