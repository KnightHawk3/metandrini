  Amazarashi is a Japanese rock band that continues to question modern society through its songs. I designed a user interface for their music video during my period at SIX, creative agency in Tokyo, Japan.

## Seasons die one after another

The song is the ending theme song of Tokyo Ghoul, a Japanese anime. In the music video, 20 kilograms of raw meat were cut by a laser cutter to form lyrics. I designed the user interface of the laser cutter.

## Digging Holes

I designed the user interface of a printer that appears in the music video. It is called The Lonely Crowd System, prints tweets what tweeted "I want to die" in a sea of trees.
